abstract = {Ecologists and evolutionary biologists rely on an increasingly sophisticated set of statistical tools to describe complex natural systems. One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation modeling (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects, and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully-documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the R programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square and mixed effects models, relying on familiar R syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically-independent contrasts. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Abstract. Classical path analysis is a statistical technique used to test causal hypotheses involving multiple variables without latent variables, assuming linearity, multivariate normality and a sufficient sample size. The d-separation ("d-sep") test is a generalization of path analysis that relaxes these assumptions. Although model selection using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) is well-established for classical path analysis, this model selection technique has not yet been developed for d-sep tests. In this paper I explain how to use the AIC statistic for d-sep tests and, give a worked example, and include instructions (supplemental material) to implement the analysis in the R computing language.},
