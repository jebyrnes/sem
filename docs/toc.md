## Why Structural Equation Modeling?  

### The world we grew up in  
  - ANOVA, Regression, the classics  
  
### Exploring Systems  
  - What we gain from thinking in systems  
  - The idea of a model and query engine  
  - Some super cool example  
  
### One Car, Many Engines
  - We can use many ways to fit an SEM
  - From correlations, likelihood w/ covariance, piecewise, bayes
  - These are engines that drive the model car
  - Each has costs and benefits
  - We will be as agnostic as possible to method, but present them all

### The R infrastructure  
  - lavaan and its antecedents  
  - piecewiseSEM  
  - blavaan?  
  - brms  
  
### The example data sets in this book  
  - Keeley  
  - Travis  
  - Jutila  
  - Santos and Canatella  

# (PART) The Language of SEMs {-}

\

### Boxes, Circles, and Hexagons, oh my!
  - Variable types and a brief intro to what they mean
  -  Exogenous v. Endogenous
  - Observed, Latent, Composite, Intercept
  
### Paths
  - Paths = directional
  - Undstandardized path coefficients and Regression
  - Standardized path coefficients - when to use and why
  - Range standardization
  - Standardizing nonlinear paths
  
### Recursive and non-recursive models

## Building Multivariate Causal Models

### Granger Causality

### A primer on Causality in models (sensu Pearl)
  - back door criteria
  - front door criteria
  - counterfactuals
  
### Causality and Unmeasured variables
  - The problem with Clustering
  - Group Mean Centering
  - Whither autocorrelation - breaking non-recursive models
  
### Conditional Independence and Directed Separation
