["agenda-and-notes-from-february-meeting.html", "A Agenda and Notes from February Meeting", " A Agenda and Notes from February Meeting Setup bookdown x Create roadmap for this meeting x Create a roadmap for an SEM learner Formalizing how exogenous variables are included in the basis set x Maybe provide an additional output of correlation between exogenous variables But - no reason to include those in calculating Fisher’s C Can you statistically compare two C statistics? Yes. x Use C for LRT GLMs and C-statistics x low hanging urgent fruit Nonlinearities and the C-statistics x Polynomial terms Interaction effects Jim says ignore them, then says don’t ignore, but diagnostics are separate from independence tests Testing indirect effects x p-values based tests, etc. Nah - don’t do p-value based testing Can use Jarrett’s predict function to get total effect Can then subtract direct effect if it is there Other tests of indirect pathways need to be done by hand Latent Variables in a Piecewise Framework x Can you use factor scores as another variable in the model Fitting and evaluating True multilevel models In a nutshell, you need to capture those intercepts into a different model in a separate dataset Algorithmic solution? Talked about it a lot in the context of a single multilevel model Where does this enter into SEM? We can evaluate d-sep relationships We can calculate range standardized coefficients, but not classical Std. Coefs We do not know how to properly calculate C We do not then know how to translate into AIC, or how to work with BIC Standardized coefficients for nonlinear variables &amp; glms x HAHAHAHAHA - man have we failed here so far… But Jim provides hope! And then we nail it denominator SD uses the link function Numerator is a block of linear and nonlinear variables combined With interaction effects, need to incorporate block approach Prediction with error (maybe with Jon this afternoon?) x i.e. for forecasting Simulation is the answer The problem is random effects structure Perhaps only use fixed effects? And/or sort out random effect usage The biggest problem you will have is nonlinear models Formalization of correlated errors x Derived v. estimated parameter? Derived! piecewise estimation handles this Human-understandable explanation of the front-door and back-door criteria for better model creation x maybe revisit at end of 1st day of a class Think about temporal aspect of causality see picture Categorical variables in a piecewise approach x General guidelines Comparison to multigroup modeling? Fit two different SEMs and evaluate if parameters are different Constraints not needed? Make a table comparing parameters across groups Endogenous: Binomial is a categorical response Multiple categorical levels - multinomial logistic regression multinom function in nnet package http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/ Standardization is……trickier Model evaluation in a Bayesian context ?? No one so far believe DIC Posterior Predictive P-Value How do you evaluate a basis set? How do you calculate WAIC? Classic Bayesian SEM works with Covariance matrices - so, a single likelihood Statisticians don’t love piecemeal nature of Dsep Sum Bayesian p-values? Jim says ‘good luck with that’ - lots of issues, limit to what he can focus on Need to talk with a Bayesian statistician Composite variables in a piecewise approach x Natural Fit model with no composite, then refit with derived composite Roadmap for piecewiseSEM Teaching roadmap http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/SEM/ (old) http://structuralequations.org (old) http://bit.ly/graceSEM MARCHING ORDERS - Jon: Make sure we have addressed issues with glms and c statistic in piecewiseSEM - Jon: Implement standarized coefficients for nonlinear and non-gaussian responses - Jim will validate two-stage latent variable technique with KB - Jim will make indirect effect demos and validate the for glms - Jim will validate the correlated error conclusions - Jarrett will write simulation-based prediction methods/query engine - Jarrett will turn prediction into generalized method for teasing apart indirect effects - One unit change from mean as default? User has to query with range - Compare to direct effects - Maybe specify pathways for query engine? - Jarrett/Jon will flesh out c-stat outline - Jim will flesh out an indirect effects and queries outline - Jim/Jon will outline a Latent and composite variables in piecewiseSEM paper - Jarrett/Jon will make a teaching outline for bookdown site - All will ponder multilevel model issues "],
