Yes. GLMs and C-statistics low hanging urgent fruit Nonlinearities and the C-statistics Polynomial terms Interaction effects Testing indirect effects p-values based tests, etc. Latent Variables in a Piecewise Framework Fitting and evaluating True multilevel models In a nutshell, you need to capture those intercepts into a different model in a separate dataset Algorithmic solution? Standardized coefficients for nonlinear variables &amp; glms Prediction with error (maybe with Jon this afternoon?) i.e. for forecasting Formalization of correlated errors Derived v. estimated parameter? Human-understandable explanation of the front-door and back-door criteria for better model creation Categorical variables in a piecewise approach General guidelines Comparison to multigroup modeling? Model evaluation in a Bayesian context Roadmap for piecewiseSEM "],
